# General note about how to consider roles as they are utilised in OpenFisca Aotearoa
#
# Best practice would be to not utilise roles as legal definitions, instead as a framework for structuring scenarios.
#
# For instance, a person in the role of child (family entity) should not be assumed to be a social_security__dependent_child
# or even a social_security__child. Those legal concepts should be required of the persons put in the child role.
#
# In some more generic situations the role can be used to imply a more general concept. For an example of this see: in_a_relationship which will return true if the person occupys the role of partner in a scenario.
# The decision to lean on this variable should be carefully considered in light of the definitions within the instrument of law being interpreted.
# If the instrument has it's own definition for partner - it's probably better to fashion a variable that includes the appropriate tests to that use case.

    A Person represents an individual, the minimal legal entity on which a legislation might be applied.

    The "salary" and "income_tax" variables are usually defined for the entity "Person".

    Calculate a variable applied to a "Person" (e.g. access the "salary" of a specific month with person("salary", "2017-05")).
    Check the role of a "Person" in a group entity (e.g. check if a the "Person" is a "owner" in a "Titled_Property" entity with person.has_role(Titled_Property.owner)).
