# We define the `jobseeker_support` variable.
#
# Please note that by itself a `variable` is not a rule but just a
# specification of such a rule.
#
# A `variable` can contain several rules, otherwise called `formulas`, that is,
# several ways it can be calculated, depending on ther date at which we want to
# calculate it. Said otherwise, as a `concept`, any modelled benefit like
# `jobseeker_support` exist since big bang until big crunch, yet the way of
#  calculating it depends on the applicable law at the requested `period`.
